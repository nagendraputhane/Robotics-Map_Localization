# ROS 2 Architecture Overview

At the core of ROS 2 is a layered architecture that enables efficient, scalable, and real-time communication between the various components of a robotics system. Below is a breakdown of the main layers and components:

## 1. DDS Middleware

- **DDS (Data Distribution Service)** is an industrial-grade communication protocol.
- **Functions of DDS:**
  - **Node Discovery:** Automatically detects other nodes in the network.
  - **Message Serialization:** Converts messages to a format suitable for transmission.
  - **Message Transport:** Handles the actual sending and receiving of messages.
- **Supported DDS Implementations:**
  - **Cyclone DDS**
  - **Fast DDS**
  - **Connext DDS**
  
  *Note: ROS 2 can support different DDS implementations, allowing developers to choose the one that best fits their needs.*

## 2. ROS Middleware Interface (rmw)

- Once a DDS implementation is chosen, ROS 2 uses an abstraction layer called **ROS Middleware (rmw)**.
- **Role of rmw:**
  - Provides a uniform interface between ROS 2 and the underlying DDS middleware.
  - Enables ROS 2 to support multiple DDS vendors or even different communication implementations without changing higher-level code.

## 3. ROS Client Library (rcl)

- The **ROS Client Library (rcl)** sits on top of the rmw layer.
- **Purpose of rcl:**
  - Implements the core functionalities of ROS 2.
  - Offers APIs that developers use to interact with ROS 2’s communication and system features.
  
## 4. Language-specific Client Libraries

- **APIs and Interfaces:**
  - Developed for various programming languages to facilitate application development.
  - **Examples:**
    - **rclcpp**: The C++ client library.
    - **rclpy**: The Python client library.
- **Usage:**
  - These libraries are what developers interact with directly when building robotics applications using ROS 2.

# ROS Overview and Architecture

> **Note:** ROS is not an actual operating system; it is a robotics middleware—a set of software libraries and tools—that runs on top of an operating system (like Linux). Its purpose is to simplify the development of complex robotic systems.

## 1. Hardware Abstraction

- **Purpose:** ROS provides a standardized interface to manage and interact with a robot's hardware.
- **Key Points:**
  - **Hardware Drivers:** ROS uses drivers (often implemented as ROS packages) that serve as the interface between the actual hardware and the operating system.
  - **Abstraction Layer:** These drivers abstract the details of the hardware, allowing users to interact with sensors, actuators, and other devices through a common interface.
  - **Benefit:** This abstraction makes it easier to develop robotic applications without needing to manage low-level hardware details.

## 2. Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

In ROS, different functionalities of a robot are implemented as separate processes called **nodes**.

### Nodes

- **Definition:** A node is an individual process that performs a specific task (e.g., path planning, obstacle detection).
- **Example:** One node might plan a path to a target while another node detects obstacles along the way.

### Communication Mechanisms Between Nodes

ROS provides several methods for nodes to communicate:

#### a. Topics

- **Mechanism:** Publisher-Subscriber Model.
- **How It Works:**
  - **Publisher:** A node sends messages to a named topic.
  - **Subscriber:** Other nodes subscribe to that topic to receive messages.
- **Usage:** Topics are used for streaming data, such as sensor readings or status updates.
- **Note:** Multiple nodes can publish or subscribe to the same topic, facilitating many-to-many communication.

#### b. Services

- **Mechanism:** Client-Server Model.
- **How It Works:**
  - **Client:** A node sends a service request to a specific service.
  - **Server:** Another node receives the request, processes it, and sends back a response.
- **Usage:** Services are used for synchronous, request-response interactions, such as querying a robot's state or commanding a specific action.

#### c. Actions

- **Mechanism:** Asynchronous Client-Server Model.
- **How It Works:**
  - **Action Client:** A node sends a goal request to an action server.
  - **Action Server:** Processes the goal over time and can provide feedback or status updates.
- **Usage:** Actions are suitable for long-running tasks that require progress feedback, such as moving to a target location or executing a complex maneuver.
- **Benefit:** They allow the client to cancel the action if needed, making them more flexible for time-consuming operations.

## 3. Package Management in ROS

ROS organizes software into packages, which can include code for robot control, vision, navigation (e.g., nav2), simulation, and more.

### Workspace Structure

- **Underlay:**
  - Refers to the pre-installed ROS 2 distribution, which includes all the standard packages.
- **Overlay:**
  - A separate workspace (often called the `workspace` folder) where you develop your custom robot code.
  - **Shadowing Concept:** If a package exists in both the underlay and the overlay, the version in the overlay takes precedence. This allows you to customize or extend functionality without modifying the base ROS distribution.
