## ðŸ“Œ Objectives and Study Areas

### 1. Differential Kinematics
- **Objective:** Study the motion of a self-driving robot.
- **Implementation:** Develop equations to translate joystick velocity commands into well-controlled motion commands.
- **Significance:** Differential kinematics is the foundation for all robotic movements and is essential for executing precise maneuvers.

### 2. Odometry Computation
- **Objective:** Estimate the robot's motion using feedback from sensors.
- **Implementation:** Use data from encoder sensors (which convert wheel rotation into digital signals) to calculate the robot's overall movement.
- **Significance:** Odometry is crucial for tracking the robot's position during its movements.

### 3. Sensor Fusion
- **Objective:** Improve the robot's odometry and movement accuracy.
- **Implementation:**
  - Fuse data from multiple sensors, including encoders, accelerometers, and gyroscopes.
  - Address the issue of sensor noise, which can reduce accuracy.
  - Implement a **Kalman Filter** to mitigate the effects of sensor noise and enhance motion estimation.
- **Significance:** Sensor fusion provides more reliable and accurate positioning by combining multiple data sources.
